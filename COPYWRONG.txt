Copyright is wrong. You cannot own information.

However, most of the world thinks this isn't true. So in order
to obey the commandments of God while maintaining my vindication,
I must avoid the use of any copyrighted works in my work.

This entire repository, every single byte (insofar as I can tell)
is given to you under the CC0 public domain license.

This includes logos and artwork.

LOGO ARTWORK

The image of a fish is a stylized rendition of Duane Raver's Black Sea Bass,
which according to wikimedia commons is a public domain work.

All font artwork was hand-drawn in GIMP. the .xcf file is provided.

This was done so that the compiler (and all the libraries attached)
may be properly _yours_.

This compiler should not belong to any individual person, but rather
to mankind as a whole.


POSSIBLE COPYRIGHT ERRORS

if there are any copyright errors in the repository (even a single byte)
please post an issue on github. 

NOTABLE SOURCES OF COPYRIGHT ERRORS

1. COMPILED BINARIES LEFT IN THE SOURCE TREE

    While testing stuff I sometimes write small programs and compile them inside
    the repository's source tree. If there are any such binaries left in the repo,
    please note that they may not be fully public domain. You should delete them
    and notify me on github/codeberg.

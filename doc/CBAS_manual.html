    Statement of Purpose
    
    The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer 
    exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator 
    and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work 
    of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
    
    Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
    purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
    ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
    infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute
    as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including
    without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the
    Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
    creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater
    distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
    
    For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
    additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
    Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
    and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
    publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
    Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
    
    1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
    protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights
    ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but
    are not limited to, the following:
    
    the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
    moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
    publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
    rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
    rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
    database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the
    Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation
    thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and other similar, 
    equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty,
    and any national implementations thereof.
    2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law,
    Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and
    surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action,
    whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action),
    in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable
    law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any
    number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
    advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
    member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending
    that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other
    legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by
    Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
    
    3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or
    ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted
    taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is
    so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, 
    non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's 
    Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum 
    duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current 
    or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without 
    limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed 
    effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any 
    reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or 
    ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby 
    affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights 
    in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, 
    in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
    
    4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
    
    No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed
    or otherwise affected by this document.
    Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind 
    concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation 
    warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement,
    or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, 
    whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
    Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to 
    the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related 
    Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, 
    permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
    Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has 
    no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

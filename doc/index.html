    <p>Seabass, as an idea, a programming language, a working program, and a concept, are all gifts I have been given. God put it into my hand to make them. From creating heaven and earth in six days, to freely giving us eternal life, to the simple joy of breathing, let all thanks and praise be directed to God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

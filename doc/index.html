    <p>Seabass, as an idea, a programming language, a working program, and a concept, are all gifts I have been given. God put it into my hand to make them. From creating heaven and earth in six days, to freely giving us eternal life, to the simple joy of breathing, let all thanks and praise be directed to God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

    <p>To you, beloved, I wish with all gravity the following for you, in order of importance:</p>
    <p>* That you would know there is one God who made Heaven and Earth in six days. The universe is not billions of years old and you are not related to fish.</p>
    <p>* That you would know that God loves you, and that he gave his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, so that your sins could be forgiven and you could rise from the dead to live forever with him in eternal everlasting joy and peace, in a place where there is no pain, no crying, and no tears.</p>
    <p>* That during your days here in the age of sin, you would have peace and happiness.</p>
    <p>* That your adventures, both here and hereafter, be grander than you can possibly imagine. May your dreams be not only fulfilled, but superseded in every possible fashion. May your whole life be an epic, a grand story to fill the endless ages to come.</p>
    <p>* That the meager works of my hands would bring you joy in the labor and toil of your hands.</p>

        <li><i><b>64 bit</b></i><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Having a 64 bit address space (i.e. "cbas was written for 64 bit byte-addressable POSIX systems")</li>

        <li><i><b>Byte-addressable</b></i><br>
            Of a computer platform, the ability to address memory by 8-bit chunks. This is as opposed to non-byte-addressable systems, such as the PDP-12, which has memory addressed by 12-bit chunks.<br>
            [Systems programming lingo]
        </li>
        <li><b>CBAS / cbas</b><br>
            The tool which works with Seabass programs, originally written
            in C99 for 64 bit byte-addressable POSIX machines.
        </li>
        <li><i><b>Compiler</b></i><br>
            A piece of code which turns one computer language into another.<br>

            Small piece of source code text.<br>

        </li>
        <li><i><b>Parser</b></i><br>
            A piece of computer code which discerns the structure of a computer program from its source code and constructs an AST.<br>
            [Programming language lingo]
        </li>
        <li><i><b>Identifier</b></i><br>
            Name for an object in a computer program. Seabass uses C rules for identifiers.<br>
            [Programming language lingo]
        </li>
        <li><i><b>Keyword</b></i><br>
            Reserved, special sequence of english characters, underscores, and decimal digits. May not start with a digit.<br>[Programming language lingo]
        </li>
        <li><b>codegen</b><br>
            short for "code generation". Adjective. Keyword in the SEABASS language.<br>
            Applied to a function, method, or variable: that function/method/variable
            "exists" only during the execution of the cbas tool.
        </li>
        <li><b>Target</b><br>
            The computer language which a program desires to be compiled for.<br>
            In Seabass, any code which is not "codegen" is considered "target", meaning
            its purpose is to be translated into some other language.

    <h2 id="whatis">What is Seabass?</h2>
    </center>
    <hr>
    <p>Seabass is a public domain, self-retargeting, self-extending, self-modifying metaprogramming language, and general purpose metaprogramming tool.</p>
    <p>Allow me to elaborate:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Public Domain</h3>
            <p>Seabass (language, tool, documentation, libraries, and artwork) are all released to you under the CC0 license. No attribution is required and no license files are needed. These are my gifts to you in perpetuity, so long as you can retain them. May your joy be full.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Language</h3>
            <p>Seabass is a programming language- a written language for expressing computer programs.</p>
        </li>        
        <li>
            <h3>Tool</h3>
            <p>Seabass is an executable computer program (cbas) which can be compiled for 64 bit POSIX-compatible systems with byte-addressable memory. It is used for working with programs written in the Seabass language. To distinguish between the Language and the Tool, the language shall be called "Seabass" and the tool shall be called "cbas" or "CBAS" (all pronounced "SEE BASS"). Tools other than this tool shall not be called "cbas" or "CBAS" but instead shall be referred to by some other name (i.e. "the Seabass Standard Metaprogramming Library").</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Metaprogramming</h3>
            <p>Seabass contains special language constructs for writing code which writes code, or manipulates pre-existing code. This is designed to allow the user to implement their own abstractions to the language, even entire new compiled languages.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Self-retargeting</h3>
            <p>Seabass allows the user to define a special function called "codegen_main" which is responsible for generating "target code". This allows programmers to define how their code should be compiled.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Self-extending</h3>
            <p>Seabass allows you to write code which effectively extends the capabilities of the compiler. This can be done within the translation unit and does not require modifying the cbas tool. This code is referred to as "codegen".</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Self-modifying</h3>
            <p>codegen code is given virtually unrestricted access to the internals of the compiler. It can modify the tokenized source code which has yet to be parsed, or even manipulate the AST of code which has already been parsed.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>To explain what this all means, let me discuss how Seabass differs from the C language:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Public Domain</b><br>
            The C language itself is public domain- standardized internationally for free and open use...
            But most tools written to work with C programs are not. Cbas, however, is public domain from its onset.

    <p>Seabass, as an idea, a programming language, a working program, and a concept, are all gifts I have been given. God put it into my hand to make them. From creating heaven and earth in six days, to freely giving us eternal life, to the simple joy of breathing, let all thanks and praise be directed to God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

    <p>To you, beloved, I wish with all gravity the following for you, in order of importance:</p>
    <p>* That you would know there is one God who made Heaven and Earth in six days. The universe is not billions of years old and you are not related to fish.</p>
    <p>* That you would know that God loves you, and that he gave his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, so that your sins could be forgiven and you could rise from the dead to live forever with him in eternal everlasting joy and peace, in a place where there is no pain, no crying, and no tears.</p>
    <p>* That during your days here in the age of sin, you would have peace and happiness.</p>
    <p>* That your adventures, both here and hereafter, be grander than you can possibly imagine. May your dreams be not only fulfilled, but superseded in every possible fashion. May your whole life be an epic, a grand story to fill the endless ages to come.</p>
    <p>* That the meager works of my hands would bring you joy in the labor and toil of your hands.</p>

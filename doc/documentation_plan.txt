I would like to make 4 kinds of documentation:

* Tutorials- Handhold users through writing seabass programs, for newbs

* How-to guides- show how to do certain things in seabass for higher-level programmers

* Reference- Dry technical docs for people who just need to know function prototypes

* Explanation- Theory discussion for people who want to grok the tool. Experts.

        Welcome, beloved.
        <br><i>Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</i> - Romans 4:7
    </p>
    <p>This page contains my concerns for you with regards to Copywrong.</p>

    <h2 id="copywrong">Copywrong</h2>
    </center>
    <hr>
    <p>When someone makes a copy of an intellectual work, the original is completely unaffected. The original
    owner still has their intellectual property and are free to use it just as they did before a copy was made.</p>
    <p>This act, of creating a copy, is completely innocent and should not be criminalized. The original
    owner of the work still has their copy. No theft has taken place.</p>
    <p>Thus, the act of "Piracy" <b>(Copywronger propaganda term)</b> is completely innocent.</p>
    <p>However, there is a way that intellectual property can be genuinely stolen:</p>
    <p>If a man destroys, damages, or hinders another man's copy of a work, they have stolen it.<br>
    Before the act, they were able to enjoy their work in peace. After the act, the work was removed.</p>
    <p>The reality of "Copyright law" is that not only does it criminalize the completely innocent act of copying,<br>
    but it legalizes genuine theft.</p>
    <p>If a person possesses a copy of a work which was obtained in a fashion not approved by the "Copyright holder" 
    then the Copyright holder is legally empowered to remove that person's ability to enjoy the work.</p>
    <p>Even more heinously, should any kind and thoughtful person create a copy of the work they are enjoying
    a friend, the "Copyright holder" can take them to court and ruin their life... for being nice!</p>
    <p>These draconian, wicked, exploitative laws are made so that evil people can make more
    money from making intellectual work, because after they make it, they can steal from people
    who make "illegal copies".</p>
    <p>The common defense for these wicked laws is that without them, there would be "no way" for people to make
    money writing books, video games, TV shows, etcetera. Confront a copyright advocate, and you will likely be
    ridiculed as a hypocrite, that "none of your favorite X would exist without copyright" (Where X is some category
    of intellectual work you enjoy.</p>
    <p>However, this is not only demonstrably false, but totally reprehensible from the onset.</p>
    <p>To demonstrate how ridiculous this is, imagine if someone decided to pass a law saying that 
    chair manufacturers could sue you for sitting wrong. This ridiculous law would then be justified 
    by saying that nobody would ever bother making chairs if we didn't have them, and that the fact
    you enjoy chairs proves you're actually a hypocrite.</p>
    <p>Not only is it totally incorrect (People have been making chairs for hundreds if not thousands of years
    without exploitative evil chair regulation laws) but the whole basis for such an idea is purely evil- that a person
    should "own" the right to control other peoples' lives.</p>
    <h3>But doesn't copyright protect creators from having their work stolen?</h3>
    <p>As discussed before, piracy is not theft. If someone "steals" your idea, you still have
    your copy of the idea. You don't suddenly "not have it anymore". Furthermore, <b>Copyright may actually be (ab)used to steal
    YOUR WORK from you</b>.</p>
    <p>If someone else just-so-happens to have come up with an idea that's "too similar" to yours, they can
    claim that you are violating their copyright and demand you shut down your operation.</p>
    <p>This sort of thing happens all the time and is especially prevalent in patent law.</p>
    <p>The brutal reality of copyright is that <b>It only helps people with large legal teams</b>.</p>
    <p>If you are a small independent creative laborer, it is not only a legitimate fear, but a likely
    outcome that if your work is "too good" that someone will <b><i>steal</i></b> it from you. Not just
    pirate it.</p>
    <p>I, David Webster, live in fear that some big corporation with tons of lawyers will come
    and <b><i>steal</i></b> my work from me, claiming I've stepped on their patent or used their API
    or whatever. Copyright is what empowers sinners to do this. I pray that the Lord Jesus Christ 
    protect me from such wicked men.</p>
    <p>Seabass, as a project, could one day vanish from the internet in a single moment because
    Google, Amazon, Apple, Oracle, Khronos, or you-name-it sends me a DMCA notice. If that happens,
    I have no legal recourse (I have no income, I have no lawyers). The project will be over. I won't
    have any way to stop it.</p>
    <p>It is thus highly recommended to you, dear reader, that you download the repository from
    one of these links and back it up on your computer if you are at all interested in the project:</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/gek169/seabass">Github URL</a><br>
    <a href="https://codeberg.org/gek/seabass">Codeberg URL</a><br>

    <p>I do not desire to exploit you, beloved, so seabass is 100 percent Public Domain software.<br>
    It is my hope that it will bring you immense joy and pleasure in the labor of your hands.</p>
    <p>I surrender any and all legal powers granted me by the state to "come after you" for making
    "illegal" copies. To the maximum possible extent granted me by the law, I grant you a permanent
    irrevocable license to enjoy Seabass (everything in those repositories, and I really do mean everything) 
    howsoever you please (Saving that you may not steal it from me or anyone else- See the CC0 License.)</p>
    <p>For exact "legalese" details of all this, see the CC0 license at the bottom of the page.</p>

    <p>Most Beloved, I have labored tirelessly to save you from the demonic influences of copywrong,
    however I am but one man, and the forces of evil are seemingly everywhere. So I acknowledge
    that I may have genuinely violated some portion of these wicked, evil laws. I predict or know I
    have done so in one of these fashions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>I may have left compiled binaries in the source tree, and I believe there are some in the git history.<br>
        These compiled binaries may contain static or dynamic linkages to copywrong'd software such as SDL2 and GCC.</li>
        <li>I used the C programming language and C standard library to write the Seabass metacompiler
        and its </li>
        <li>I used copyrighted OpenGL and OpenAL documentation to create the OpenGL and OpenAL wrappers.<br>
        the function prototypes were converted almost verbatim.</li>
        <li>SDL2 was used to implement `fun.hbas` and `funbas.hbas`. SDL2 itself is not included in
        the source code, however SDL2 is directly called. SDL2 does not require any form of attribution
        however it does worryingly say that it requires you may not misrepresent the origins of the
        software. Granted that I include none of SDL2 itself, this should not be an issue.</li>
        <li>A snippet of (most likely copyrighted) code was converted by-hand to implement `glPerspective` in
        `gl1_1.hbas`. This code was originally found on `nehe`'s game dev website, but I also found out Khronos
        provided the same code.</li>
        <li>The likely trademarked names __WIN32__ and __APPLE__ appear in the source code of the Seabass
        metacompiler.</li>
        <li>The name "GNU" Likely appears somewhere, and gcc/clang/tinycc are each mentioned by name.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These admissions are here for your benefit, beloved, so that you may be aware of possible persecution
    by the state should your copy be considered "illegal"</p>

    <p>To all creative, thoughtful men I plead the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Pray that the Lord our God would destroy these wicked evil laws.</li>
        <li>Release your works under as permissive a license as possible, requiring no attribution.</li>
        <li>Spread awareness of how copywrong not only fails to protect small creators but enables genuine legal theft.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Above all, beloved, Let all your things be done with charity, acknowledge God in all you do, and walk in His ways.</p>
    <p>For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.<br>- Romans 10:4</p>

CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
  and translate a Work;

  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
  depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
  a Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
  or other rights required for any use of the Work.

  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
  CC0 or use of the Work.

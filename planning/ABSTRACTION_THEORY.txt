THE MATHEMATICS OF ABSTRACTION

    All Glory to the Lord Jesus Christ, who
    created all things. Amen.

BASIC TERMINOLOGY
Let a "Token" be a finite sequence of characters comprising an indivisible unit of meaning.
Let a "grammar" be a set of rules which define whether a sequence of tokens is "allowed"
Let a language be a set of tokens (possibly infinite) and a grammar which defines the validity of token sequences for that language
Let a "document" be a particular sequence of tokens in a language
Let a "computational automata" be a deterministic automata whose actions are controlled by its interpretation of a document in a particular language
Let an "Abstract machine" be an imaginary (or real) computational automata which is defined by how it behaves in relation to the contents of a document in its language
Let a program be a document which is interpretable by a particular abstract machine
Let a Program-verse (Pverse) be the set of all programs for an abstract machine
Let a compiler be a program which accepts programs from some Pverse and emits programs in another (possibly different) pverse
~~~~
"DOMAIN COMPLETENESS"
A compiler is "Domain complete" if all programs in the destination pverse are possible outputs of the compiler.
I.E.
Given a compiler C which accepts programs in P-verse A and emits programs in Pverse B, then for any program 'p' in B, there exists at least one program 'q' in A such that...
q => c => p
~~~
"EFFICIENT DOMAIN COMPLETENESS"
A compiler is "efficiently domain complete" respective to a program-verse B if, for all programs q in B there exists a p in A for which the following is true:

Length_in_characters(p) <= Length_in_characters(q)
~~~
DEFINITION OF "ECHO"
Let the identity compiler on a given Pverse A be the compiler which performs no permutations on its input and emits its input verbatim, also known as "echo on A"
~~~
PROPERTIES OF ECHO
* Echo is efficiently domain complete.
* All programs in Echo are bprogs
* Length of programs is always exactly equal
* Echo is an error-free compiler
~~~
"BPROG"
Let the "briefest program" (bprog) with respect to some efficiently domain-complete compiler C be a program where the following is true:

bprog => C => q

there is no program "p" such that...
p=>C=>q and len(p) < len(bprog)
~~~
DOMAIN SPECIFIC COMPILERS

Two efficiently domain complete compilers C1,C2 are said to be "domain specific" if there exists some programs p11, p12, p21, p22, q1, q2 where the following is true:

p11 => C1 => q1
p12 => C1 => q2
p21 => C2 => q1
p22 => C2 => q2

p11,p12 are bprogs of C1
p21,p22 are bprogs of C2

len(p11) < len(p21)
len(p22) < len(p12)
~~~
THE POSED QUESTION

Is there a scheme for taking an efficiently 
domain-complete compiler C with pverses A,B where

A => C => B

and creating a new compiler, C2, where

A'=> C'=> B

such that C and C' are not domain specific, and there are
bprogs p1 and p2, where

p1 => C => B
p2 => C'=> B
len(p2) < len(p1)
~~~
THE DOCUMENT TRANSFORMATION FUNCTION

Let a "Document transformation function" Dfunc be a program which accepts
a document D as input and performs some operation on the document, producing
an output document D'

D => Dfunc => D'

(Note that it is irrelevant what the document transformation function actually
runs on with respect to D and D')

Per our definitions, compilers are document transformation functions
~~~
DOCUMENT TRANSFORMATION FUNCTION COST

For a given Dfunc and D, let the "cost" of a transformation be

len(D') - len(D)

A positive cost meaning that the document increased in length, and
a negative cost meaning that it decreased in length.

An efficiently domain-complete compiler always has zero or negative
cost.
~~~
INVALID DOCUMENTS

A document D is "invalid" with respect to some compiler C if it does not
result in the compiler producing a valid program in its output domain B.

D => C => !B

In practice, this would generally be some form of syntax error.

~~~
ERROR-FREE COMPILER

A Compiler is "error-free" if there are no invalid documents with respect
to that compiler.

I.e., if D is the set of all possible documents, and B is the set
of all possible

D => C => B
~~~
INVALID DOCUMENT CREATION FUNCTION (IDCF)

Let an Invalid Document Creation Function (IDCF) be a document
transformation function which accepts all documents
